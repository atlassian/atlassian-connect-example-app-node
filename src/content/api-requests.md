### Making API requests

If you need to make API requests from the Connect iframe, this can be easily achieved via the use of the 
[node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) library. Both [Jira](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/rest/intro/#introduction) 
and [Confluence](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/using-the-rest-api/) provide and extensive 
REST API to build add-ons.
